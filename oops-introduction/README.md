## Intro to Object Oriented Programming

- Object Oriented programming is the programming paradigm which uses the object to design the applications and programs. It simplifies the software development and maintainability of the code.
- OOPS brings the data and behaviour together into a single entity called "objects".
- Object oriented programming covers the base principles of oops include abstraction, inheritence, polymorphism and encapsulation.

### Terminology of OOPS:

- Object: An object is the real entity that has both state and behaviour. For example, the car has states such as color, price, and model as well as behavior include speed, start, stop etc...

- Class: A class is the blueprint/ a complete template for the objects. We can create as many objects as we can 
using class.

- Abstraction: it is the concept where we can how only relevant data and hide unnecessary details to the user.

- Encapsulation: it is concept where we bing the state and behavior of the object together. if we are creating a class we are actually doing encapsulation (or) packing of the data members and methods into single template is called encapsualtion.

- Inheritence: It is the oops features, the process in which acquiring the properties of the one class to the another class.

- Polymorphism: It is the feature, where we can perform a single action in different ways.

### Advantages of OOPS:
- Code Reusability
- Maintainabilty
- Redability
- Security
- Flexibility
