## JAVA keywords

### Static Keyword

Static keyword can be used in class, method, variables and a block. If we declare a memeber with static block, that belongs to the class not any specific instance. We can call the properties and methods of the class without using an object.

### Static Block

The static block is used to initialize the static variables in the class. This block gets executed when it is loaded into the memory. the static blocks gets executed in which order they have created.

### Static Variables

Static variables are shared among all the instances. If we change the values of the static variables using an object, every object gets impacted becuase the members are shared among all the objects.

### Static Class

We can declare a static class only if the class is nested class.

### Super Keyword

The super keyword referes to the objects of the immediate parent class.

### The use of super keyword
1. To access the data memebers of the parent class when the child class have the same names
2. To explicitly call the no-arg or parameterized constructor.
3. To access the method of the parent class that has overridden method.
