## Inheritenece in Java

Inheritence is the object oriented programming features, in which acquiring the properities and features of one class to the another class. The main purpose of the inheritence is reusability of the code, redability and maintainability.

### Terminology of Inheritence

- **Super class/ Base class/Parent class:** The class which provides the features to the child class.
- **Sub Class/ Derived class/ Child class:** The class which takes the features from the parent class.

### Advantages of Inheritence
- Resuability of the code
- Removes the code redundancy
- Reduces the code size
- Improve logical structure

### Types of Inheritence

In Java, Inheritence is classified into different types:
1. Single Inheritence
2. Multi-level Inheritence
3. Heirarchial Inheritence
4. Hybrid Inheritence
5. Multiple Inheritence (Not supports in Java)

### Inheritence Access Specifier

The child class can only access the data memebers and methods of the parent class
only if the access specifiers are public or protected. The private access specifiers in the
parent class cannot inherit.

Note: The final classes are not able to perfrom the inheritence.
