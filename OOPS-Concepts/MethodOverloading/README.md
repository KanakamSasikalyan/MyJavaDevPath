## Method Overloading

Method overloading is a object oriented programming feature, that allows to define the methods with the same name but difference in parameters in terms of sequence, type and number of parameters.

In short, we can say the same method name but different method signatures.

### Three ways to do method overloading

We can implement the overloading in different ways, include:
1. Number of parameters.
2. Data types of parameters
3. Sequence of parameters

### Type Promotion
byte => short => char => int => long => float => double

### Quick points
1. Method overloading is a technique where we can define a single method but difference in parameters in terms of number of parameters, sequence of parameters, and data types of the parameters.
2. Method overloading allows the code reusability and easy-maintainance.
3. Method overloading is the example of the static polymorphism / static binding, methods are resolved at the compile time.
