## Relationships between classes

The concepts of association, aggregation, composition, and specialization are all part of object-oriented design (OOD). Object-oriented design is a subset of object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on the planning and structuring of software systems using objects and classes.

### Association

It is the feature, that allows us to establish the relationship between the classes through their objects. In association, the relationship can be one-one, one-many, many-one, many-many.
- Association can be unidirectional or bidirectional.

### Aggregation

It is the features, that allows us to establish the relationship between the classes through their object. In the aggregation ,the relationship is unidirectional (1 way)
aggregation is the one of the form of the association. It contains "has-a" relationship.

### Composition
it is the feature to establish the relationship between the classes, it is the form of the association. it implements the "part-of" relationship. It is the stronger form of aggregation.

Composition is a type of association that represents a "part-of" relationship between two classes. It is a stronger form of aggregation where the contained object cannot exist independently of the container object. If the container object is destroyed, the contained object is also destroyed.

### Specialization

Specialization is the concept that is related to the Inheritence.
